# Signing Stuff

Most of this directory is the NEM lightwallet code, heavily modified to
not be as much spaghetti as it currently is. Also I made it work with nodejs.

Note that there is a lot of broken stuff in here, as if it's not implemented
yet in the high level API (read: not inside this folder), then I haven't taken
the time to fix it yet.
